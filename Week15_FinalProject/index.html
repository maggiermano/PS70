            <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 17px; padding: 10px;">
                Roads that have potholes on them are not only an inconvenience, but can also be very dangerous to drivers
                and other users of the road. In my home country, Zimbabwe, potholes are a huge issue and the roads are sometimes undriveable due to
                the amount and/or sizes of potholes. The issue is enhanced by lack of government support and efficiency
                to solve the pothole problem leading to many dangerous roads in the country. The presence of potholes
                can cause burst or flat tires, dangerous roads in rainy/slippery conditions as well as increases travel
                time for those using those roads.

            <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 17px; padding: 10px;">
                Recognizing the urgency of this issue, I came up with the idea of "The Pothole Probe" - a machine with
                depth detecting sensors that moves up and down a road/path and attempts to fill the pothole with tar/gravel.
                For this project, I would be building a model of The Pothole Probe that simulates the intentions of the
                actual machine. The model would move along a straight path which would simulate moving up or down a road.
                Sensors would be attached to the base of the machine that detect differences in depth on a surface in order
                to detect the holes as the machine moves along.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 17px; padding: 10px;">
                At first, I was going to focus on the driving aspect of this machine. My plan was to make the machine
                automated where motors were used to drive it along a predefined path. However, because the concept of
                a driving robot is widely known and many designs for them already exist, I decided to shift my focus
                to creating a mechanism that would fill the pothole immediate after detection. Thus, my project
                instead centered on creating a machine that dispensed gravel into a pothole below immediately after
                the sensors on the machine detected it. The machine would utilize many tools learnt in the duration of
                the course such as: 3D printing, laser cutting, electronics, etc.

            <em style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 25px;">Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Design</em>
            <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 17px; padding: 10px;">
                For my MVP design I focused on implementing my electronic input and output devices so that they work in
                conjunction with each other. I also worked to get the main mechanism that dispenses gravel assembled.
                I used Fusion to create a 3D model of the idea I had for my project. The image below displays this initial
                model where a bucket or container (where the gravel would lie) is placed atop a box. The base
                of the gravel container would have an opening where gravel would fall into the opening of the box. The box
                will contain a rotary valve mechanism (as seen on the right-hand side of the model) that rotates automatically
                due to the weight of the gravel. The box will also have an opening at its base to allow gravel to be
                dispensed into the pothole below.
            </p>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-top: 20px;">
                <img src="img/image3.png" alt="Image 3" style="width: 60%; height: auto; padding-bottom: 10px;">
                <div class="right-images" style="flex-grow: 1; display:flex; flex-direction: column;">

            </div>
            <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 17px; padding: 10px;">
                Potholes will be detected using an ultrasonic sensor attached to the base of the box. Ultrasonic sensors
                measure the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves. If attached to the base of the machinery,
                the sensors will detect and record differences in depth, thus you would be able to tell if a pothole is
                present. A solenoid will be used to control whether the rotary valve should dispense gravel or not.
                When activated the solenoid will block the valve from rotating. Once a significant enough depth is detected
                by the ultrasonic sensors to warrant a pothole, the solenoid will be de-activated to allow the rotary valve
                to move and dispense gravel. Gravel will be dispensed for a set amount of time until the solenoid is activated
                again which will mark the filling of the pothole.
            </p>
            <em style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 25px;">MVP Assembly</em>
            <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 17px; padding: 10px;">
                The MVP consists of three key items:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ultrasonic sensor to detect depth/distance (pothole detector)</li>
                <li>Gravity-dependent rotary valve dispenser</li>
                <li>Solenoid to stop are start the dispensing</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Altogether these three elements create the mechanism needed to detect, dispense gravel as well as stop
                the valve once the pothole has been filled. Thus, this Minimal Viable Product fulfills the purpose of The
                Pothole Probe.

                        <li>I decided to 3D print the X-shaped part of the valve, so that I wouldn't have to use wood and
                            glue to create it. I designed the hole in the center to be 5mm in diameter - the same size as
                            the wooden dowel I would use to hold the valve in place.</li>
                        <li>I used the CNC machine to mill holes for the base of the valve. I could have drilled the holes,
                            but this would have taken a lot more time and would not have yielded as accurate results.</li>
                        <li>The purpose of the holes is to stop the valve with the solenoid. The solenoid will act as a
                            plug and plug into one of the holes as the valve is rotating.</li>

                        <li>After completing the rotary valve, I attached them using a wooden dowel and a bit of
                            hot glue for stability purposes (although due to the tight fit from accurate milling and printing
                            there was little need for glue).</li>
                        <li>I laser cut two side walls that hold the valve above ground, so that it has full range of motion.
                            I hot glued these walls to a cardboard base. This area of the design is definitely not as stable and
                            the assembly mechanisms will change in future iterations. I imagine a top wooden panel for future
                            iterations where the bucket of gravel will rest.</li>
                        <li>I also made a table attached to the left side panel for solenoid to sit on and secured the solenoid
                            there using a zip tie. This is also likely to be replaced by a cleaner and more sturdy design.</li>

                The MVP had the correct functionality of the machine, but the assembly was shoddy work that included way
                too much hot glue and cardboard than I would have liked. I decided to keep the rotary valve mechanism as
                is with only a few adjustments, but threw away the rest of the assembly and started from scratch. I replaced
                the hot glue connections with screws for a more permanent but neat finish. I also added a base to the machine
                that had wheels, so the user could simulate moving the machine as if it were moving down a road. These changes
                are shown in the steps I took to finalize the assembly below.

                        <li>One issue I kept having with my MVP was that my solenoid would heat up very quickly. Nathan
                            informed me that this was because for the majority of time, the solenoid is activated and
                            drawing a lot of current. However, if you switched the logic and made it so the solenoid activated
                            to release the valve only when dispensing is taking place and otherwise is deactivated then
                            this problem would be minimized.</li>
                        <li>I flipped the solenoid over, but the opposite end was bigger than the end I was previously using
                            to plug the holes. This meant that I had to make the holes of the valve bigger. I drilled
                            holes that matched the size of the larger end instead (as seen in the video) before returning
                            the base of the valve to its place in assembly. </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Now that I had a base I was happy with, I wanted to make a better structure to hold the
                            solenoid in place. The solenoid had two holes that were already threaded so all I had to do
                            was screw it down to a block of wood.</li>
                        <li>I used a 30cm ruler to see what height the block would need to be. This had to be an accurate
                            reading because the solenoid had to be exactly in line with one of the holes on the base of
                            the rotary vale. Since the holes on the base were accurately positioned to be along some inner
                            circumference, this would result in the solenoid blocking the mechanism when needs be.</li>
                        <li>I changed the position of the solenoid to be near the bottom of the valve unlike the MVP
                            design which saw it near the top. This made it easier to secure the solenoid whilst achieving
                            the same effect.</li>

                            was wooden, I decided to screw the walls to the base. I used long wooden prisms to screw the
                            walls to the base by screwing them into the prism and then screwing the prism into the base.</li>

                    from the bucket in a continuous motion was hard to achieve. The solenoid didn't stay on long
                    enough for dispensing to take place. The gravel would fall through the side as well as the bottom.
                    This was my fault because I changed the design to be from a box to a an open sided box. I
                    thought it would be cooler to see the machine moving!</li>
                <li>I knew I could fix the solenoid problem, but the issue with continuous dispensing I didn't

                Some challenges I faced during the assembly process were drilling parts together. I would miscalculate the
                distance between holes and wouldnt be able to screw that component in. A way to avoid this in the future
                would be to model the drill holes into the wooden panels beforehand. That way I would only have to stick
                screws in them and fasten them. I also had to re-drill the holes at the back of the valve to make them bigger
                again. This was because the solenoid would get stuck when trying to activate with the weight of the gravel.

                The electronics aspect worked as intended during MVP week, despite the solenoid heating up. However, there
                were a lot of adjustments to be made to make the electronics aspect of the project more mobile. I needed to
                do a couple of things such as: switching out the Arduino Uno for an ESP32, securing the sensor(s) to the
                base of the machine, soldering various components, having a remote power supply, etc. These were all
                relatively simple tasks to begin with, but I ended up facing many challenges along the way.

                            solution, but a good temporary fix.</li>
                        <li>I soldered the pins to wires that extended up into the breadboard. I used the wire braiding
                            technique we learnt near the end of class to make the long wires neater and fit more compactly
                            in my machine.</li>
                        <li>I then tested the sensor to make sure the soldering worked. The pins shorted a couple times
                            due to the soldered wires touching but apart from that it worked great.</li>
                        <li>I also soldered the solenoid to wires so that I didn't have to use crocodile clips anymore.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I powered the ESP32 to a remote power source with no problems. However, when trying to use a
                            booster to supply 12V to the solenoid instead of using a plugged in power source, the machine
                            stopped working.</li>
                        <li>I think there are compatibility issues when using a booster with this specific ESP32 because
                            it would draw too much current to itself when the booster was connected instead of the power supply.
                            One one occasion it drew so much current that my laptop which was still powering it at the
                            time switched off. After this incident I decided to not use the booster, despite soldering and
                            wiring it correctly.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I adjusted the Arduino code to make it so the solenoid stays activated for a set time before
                            turning off so that gravel can be dispensed during that time.</li>
                        <li>I then attached the breadboard to the machine and attempted to test the machine again.</li>

                <li>Moving the machine was difficult but this was due to the shoddy cardboard road I had set up.
                    It would be better to drive it along a more even surface.</li>
                <li>The solenoid stayed on without turning off which I realized was because the sensors were still
                    detecting a significant distance so after the timeframe was up it started again because the distance
                    was larger than the threshold.</li>
                <li>You can hear the solenoid turn off near the end of the video once the sensors detect a surface
                    level distance again.</li>
